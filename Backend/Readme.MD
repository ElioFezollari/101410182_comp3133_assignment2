# Employee Management System - Backend
### Overview
This is a backend application developed as part of an Employee Management System. The application is designed to manage employee data using the GraphQL API. It allows users to perform various operations such as adding, updating, deleting, and retrieving employee records. The backend is built using Node.js, Express, GraphQL, and MongoDB.

As part of the development process, I have integrated GitHub for version control and utilized DevOps practices to manage the deployment pipeline.

Technologies Used
Node.js: JavaScript runtime used to build the server-side application.
Express.js: Web framework for Node.js that simplifies routing and middleware handling.
GraphQL: Query language for APIs, enabling flexible data fetching from a single endpoint.
MongoDB: NoSQL database used to store employee data.
Mongoose: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library to interact with MongoDB.
GitHub: Version control system to manage the codebase.
